# Agent-Base-Modeling-Technology-Choice
A technology choice model inspired by Brian Arthur in a population with a network structure following an Erdos-Renyi will be analyzed with different numbers of possible technologies to investigate if the number of possible technologies has an effect on the resulting market concentration.

**Outcome:**

On average Erdos-Renyi network has a higher normalized Hirschman-Herfindahl index for a small number of possible technologies.

Please read the `Technology choice` pdf for more details.
